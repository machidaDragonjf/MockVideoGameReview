        <h2> Gameplay </h2>
        <h3>"Fighing the legendary Xenomorph in VR"</h3>
        <p> So you finally get a chance to play against the most feared predator in movie history. 
            So whats it like? To start its an amazing experience that is filled with terror and fright
            and it doesn't disappoint. The xenomorph is fast and deadly and your best option is to run
            and run away fast. The Sebastapol space station is very well realized and reminds me of the station
            the Ripley wakes up in Aliens. Every little detail is recreated for a very life like atmosphere 
            that acts as an amazing setdrop of your confrontation with the xenomorph. Playing this in 
            VR is an amazing experience that really can't be matched otherwise. While the style of this game is more
            in the vain of Alien than Aliens with more focus on evasion than confrontation.  
        </p>
        <p>
            For most of the game you are armed with a pistol that can't really do much to the xenomorph except make it mad.
            You can craft items from what you find in the spaceship and even get a more powerful weapon 
            as the story goes on. The enviroment can also be used by exploding canisters that can scare the Alien awayif detonated close enough. 
            For most of my game I was hiding underneath tables and in lockers but the alien is relentless in
            in searching for you.There are even moments where you have to restrict yourr breathing to hide from this frightening beast.
            Not only do you have the xenomorph to worry about but you also have so AI based androids who can further worsen the situations. There
            is also rogue humans in the station some friendly some not. Hiding spaces are plenty as you 
            can hide in shafts, under tables and even in lockers. 
            As the game progresses you really learn how to manuever Amanda Ripley like the hero she is. You help save trapped humans,
            as well as discover other issues wth the space stastion that need to be addressed. Overall the gameplay was absoultely 
            perfect for the adventure you embark on.

        <h2> Graphics </h2>
        <h3>"Fighing the legendary Xenomorph in VR"</h3>
        <p> So how are the grphics in this frightening adventure? To put it mildly, they're amazing. From the design of the space station
            to the detail of the xenomorph everything has been meticulously crafted. The computers are designed with the 70's computer 
            designs in the Alien movie with a retro feel. The space station feels lived in and the occupants feel alive. I haven't encountered 
            this level of detail in many games since Halo. Every item looks real and thought out and the little details like steam mving through
            the grates looks unbelievably good. There is a dark element to the game that really adds to the frightening feeling and in VR its almost 
            too much to take. But don't get me wrong I absoultely loved it. After finishing Resident Evil 7 in VR I felt I was pretty tough to scare but this
            game blew that out of the water in terms of fear. 
        </p>
        <p>
           As you move through the game it is impossible not to be drawn in by the enviroment. The enviroment is so well done infact there is a mod
        out now that lets you enjoy the space station without the Alien. For a modder to create a mod like that shows that the space station has been so 
    well recreated that many people wanto to explore without the fear of the Alien cutting their tourist trip short. Overall grapically tihs game is 
as good as it is fun to play. I would like to thank the developers for delivering this truely exceptional experience. The only problem is now I really need
Alien isolation 2. </p>

        <h2> Immersion </h2>
        <h3>"Run for your life"</h3>
        <p> The Vr immersion of Alien Isolation is truely amazing. I finished the game in non-vr mode and when I went back to 
            try it in VR, I couldn't believe how much better it was. Adding scale((like Vr does) makes everyting even better. To
            see the 8 foot tall alien in front of you is truely terrifying. Other characters feel more real as well as it just feels
            more personal in VR. I really loved how the game also adds weapons as you go which makes it even better. To start out helpless 
            and slowly become more formitable is a good design choice in my opinion. Overall I feel the Vr addition is an essential part
            especially if you are a fan of the alien frnachise and want to experience it firsthand. There is  even DLc that allows you to play
            as Ripley in the first ALien along others such as Dallas,Brett and Parker.  
       </p>

        <p> Immersion in Vr is really something that is exciting in VR. Being able to feel like your there is an incredible immersion 
            factor that really put this game into its own league for me. 
             </p>
